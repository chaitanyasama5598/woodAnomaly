**Title: Industrial anomaly detection of wood texture using unsupervised learning for quality assessment process automation**

**Introduction:** Accurate and swift quality inspection is very essential for meeting planned demand as well as maintaining good customer satisfaction scores in any manufacturing industry. Majority of the industries employee workers for manual identification of product defects. Though manual QA is works well for minor industrial units, heavy manufacturing industries which mass produces physical goods needs autonomous system for manufacturing as well as quality inspection. Manual inspection will not only slow down the manufacturing process but also has serious impact business operating cost. Growing human resource cost is also one of the major factors which signals business to move out of traditional manual QA to automated one. As occurrence of defects/anomalies is a rare instance hence less data to train models, this makes modeling anomalies very difficult. This business problem of anomaly detection under the presence of low or no-data needs unsupervised machine learning and deep learning techniques instead of traditional classification-based models. Especially for current the project purpose we will be using images of manufactured wooden objects for training unsupervised models to identify possible defects in the object's texture
